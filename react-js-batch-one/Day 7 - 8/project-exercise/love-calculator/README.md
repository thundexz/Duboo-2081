Love Calculator
ðŸ’ª This is a difficult challenge! ðŸ’ª

You are going to write a function called calculateLoveScore() that tests the compatibility between two names. To work out the love score between two people:

1. Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.

2. Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.

3. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number and print it out.

e.g.

name1 = "Some random boy name" name2 = "Some random girl name"

T occurs 0 times

R occurs 3 time

U occurs 0 times

E occurs 4 times

Total = 7

L occurs 1 time

O occurs 5 times

V occurs 0 times

E occurs 4 times

Total = 10

Love Score = 710

Example Input

calculate_love_score("Kanye West", "Kim Kardashian")

Example Output
42
